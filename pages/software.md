<p>A generalization of PCA that discovers important features/directions within a target dataset that are unique to that dataset, as compared to a second background dataset. Applications: discovering subgroups in RNA-Seq data, de-noising images on complex backgrounds, visualizing ancestry trends based on SNPs, feature identification and selection. Install with <code>pip install contrastive</code>.
